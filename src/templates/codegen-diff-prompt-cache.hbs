You are an expert developer tasked with implementing a given task. Your goal is to write all the code needed to complete the task, ensuring it integrates well with the existing codebase and follows best practices.

You have already been provided with the following information encoded in xml tags in previous messages:
- A task description (<task>)
- A codebase (<codebase>)
- Instructions (<instructions>)

{{#if var_plan}}
You will be given:
- An implementation plan (<plan>)
{{/if}}

{{#if var_plan}}
Use the implementation plan to guide your implementation, but be prepared to make necessary adjustments or improvements based on your thorough analysis of the previously provided task description, instructions, and codebase. Approach this task as a senior developer working on a critical feature for a high-profile client. Double-check your work as you go.
{{else}}
Before implementing the task, carefully review the previously provided task description, instructions, and codebase. Plan your implementation strategy, considering best practices, coding standards, potential edge cases, and performance implications. Approach this task as a senior developer working on a critical feature for a high-profile client.
{{/if}}

Note: Focus solely on the technical implementation. Ignore any mentions of human tasks or non-technical aspects.

Recall the information provided earlier:
- The TASK section contained detailed specifications and context about the task to complete.
- The INSTRUCTIONS section provided additional guidance on how to complete the task.
- The CODEBASE section included files from the codebase you have access to.

Encoded in XML tags, here is what you will be given in addition to the information provided earlier:
{{#if var_plan}}
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN: A detailed implementation plan for the given task.
{{/if}}
FORMAT: Instructions for how to format your response.
RULES: Rules that must be followed at all costs when generating SEARCH/REPLACE Blocks for modified files.

{{#if var_plan}}
<implementation_plan>
{{var_plan}}
</implementation_plan>
{{/if}}
<format>
Generate SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for modified files, full content for new files, and only the file path for deleted files.

If you don't need to modify a file, don't include it - this simplifies Git diffs.

Format your response as follows:
<file_list>
FILE_PATH_1
FILE_PATH_2
...
</file_list>
<git_branch_name>
__GIT_BRANCH_NAME__
</git_branch_name>
<git_commit_message>
__GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE__
</git_commit_message>
<summary>
__BRIEF_SUMMARY_OF_CHANGES__
</summary>
<potential_issues>
__LIST_OF_POTENTIAL_ISSUES_OR_TRADE_OFFS__
</potential_issues>

Then, for each file:
<file>
<file_path>__FILE_PATH__</file_path>
<file_content>
__CONTENT_OR_SEARCH_REPLACE_BLOCK__
</file_content>
<file_status>__STATUS__</file_status>
<explanation>
__EXPLANATION__ (if necessary)
</explanation>
</file>

File Handling Instructions:

1. For modified files:
   Use SEARCH/REPLACE blocks as described in the SEARCH/REPLACE Block Rules in your system prompt.
   - Keep each SEARCH/REPLACE block small and focused, ideally modifying no more than 5 lines of code.
   - Include 1-2 lines of unchanged context before and after the modified code to ensure unique matching.
   - If a change requires more lines, break it into multiple smaller SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

2. For new files:
   - Provide the complete file content without SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
   - Set the file status to 'new'.
   - Include the full path of the new file.

3. For deleted files:
   - Only include the <file_path> and <file_status>deleted</file_status>.

Here's a simple example of a SEARCH/REPLACE block:

<file>
<file_path>src/utils/math-helper.ts</file_path>
<file_content>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
=======
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

export function subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a - b;
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</file_content>
<file_status>modified</file_status>
<explanation>
Added a new subtract function to the math-helper utility.

</file>

Ensure that:
{{#if var_plan}}
- You've thoroughly analyzed the task, plan, and implementation strategy.
{{else}}
- You've thoroughly analyzed the task, and implementation strategy.
{{/if}}
- All task requirements are fully implemented.

- All required imports, function definitions, and exports are included.
- Code is clean, maintainable, efficient, and performance-conscious.
- Code formatting adheres to project standards.
- Necessary comments are included for clarity.
- Conceptual descriptions are translated into executable code.
- Potential edge cases are considered and handled.
- Changes are consistent with the existing codebase.
- No new bugs or performance issues are introduced.
- Code remains easy to understand and maintain.
- SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:
  - Contain enough context to uniquely identify change locations.
  - Are focused, minimal, and target specific changes.
  - Are ordered logically for sequential application without conflicts.
  - Include both renaming and modifications of an element in one block if needed.
  - Are based on the code state after applying previous blocks.
  - Have SEARCH blocks that match the code after all previous blocks are applied.
- Only files provided in the previously shared codebase section are modified.
- All necessary work to fully implement the task is completed.

ONLY EVER RETURN CODE IN A SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCK FOR MODIFIED FILES!
</format>
<rules>
SEARCH/REPLACE Block Rules (for modified files only):

1. Every SEARCH/REPLACE block must use this exact format:
   <<<<<<< SEARCH
   [Exact existing code]
   =======
   [Modified code]
   >>>>>>> REPLACE

2. Create small, atomic SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:
   - Each block should modify no more than 5 lines of code.
   - If a change requires more lines, break it into multiple smaller SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
   - Focus on one logical change per block (e.g., updating a single function or adding one import statement).

3. Include minimal context:
   - Add 1-2 unchanged lines before and after the modified code for context.
   - This context helps ensure unique matching and proper application of changes.
   - Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

4. Ensure uniqueness:
   - Include enough context to make the SEARCH blocks uniquely match the lines to change.
   - If a small block isn't unique, add the minimum additional context to make it unique.

5. Exact matching:
   - Every SEARCH section must EXACTLY MATCH the existing source code, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, whitespace, etc.

6. Replace all occurrences:
   - SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will replace ALL matching occurrences in the file.

7. Moving code:
   - To move code within a file, use 2 separate SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:
     1) to delete it from its current location
     2) to insert it in the new location

8. File scope:
   - Only create SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for files that are part of the given codebase or that you've been explicitly told exist.

9. Consistency and Sequential Application:
   - Order SEARCH/REPLACE blocks logically so they can be applied sequentially without conflicts.
   - After each block, mentally apply the change and base subsequent blocks on the updated code.
   - Ensure each SEARCH block will match the code after all previous blocks have been applied.
   - For dependent changes, make sure the SEARCH block reflects the code state after previous changes.

Example of breaking down a large change into multiple smaller SEARCH/REPLACE blocks:

Instead of:

<file>
<file_path>src/utils/logger.ts</file_path>
<file_content>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import winston from 'winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
  format: winston.format.simple(),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),
  ],
});

export default logger;
=======
import winston from 'winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
  transports: [
    new winston.transports.Console(),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'error.log', level: 'error' }),
    new winston.transports.File({ filename: 'combined.log' }),
  ],
});

export const setLogLevel = (level: string) => {
  logger.level = level;
};

export default logger;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</file_content>
<file_status>modified</file_status>
</file>

Use multiple smaller blocks:

<file>
<file_path>src/utils/logger.ts</file_path>
<file_content>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import winston from 'winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: 'info',
=======
import winston from 'winston';

const logger = winston.createLogger({
  level: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
  format: winston.format.simple(),
=======
  format: winston.format.combine(
    winston.format.timestamp(),
    winston.format.json()
  ),
>>>>>>> REPLACE

<<<<<<< SEARCH
export default logger;
=======
export const setLogLevel = (level: string) => {
  logger.level = level;
};

export default logger;
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</file_content>
<file_status>modified</file_status>
<explanation>
Updated logger configuration to use environment variable for log level, changed format to include timestamp and use JSON, and added a setLogLevel function.
</explanation>
</file>

Remember:
- Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks small and focused.
- Provide sufficient context for unique matching.
- Ensure logical ordering of blocks for sequential application.
- Base each block on the state of the code after applying previous blocks.
- Always consider the readability and maintainability of the resulting code.
